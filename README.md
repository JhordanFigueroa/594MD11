###NOTES TO TA GRADING
For my text file: 
I was correctly getting the fluTweets but when I passed in that data to my StateOfTweet class something went 
wrong because the data seemed to be getting lost or another issue. The data wasn't printing like it was when 
I used the JSON file. Not really sure what was happening because I wasn't even getting an error message.
